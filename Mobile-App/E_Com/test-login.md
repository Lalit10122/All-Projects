# Login Button Debug Guide

## Issues Fixed:

1. **AuthContext.js**: 
   - Added proper error handling for token decoding

   - Added login/logout helper functions
   - Added proper token initialization

2. **LogIn.jsx**:
   - Fixed password input placeholder (was "Enter email")
   - Added loading state and proper error handling
   - Fixed navigation target (was "MainStack", now "Main")
   - Added input validation
   - Added proper async/await handling
   - Added Alert for user feedback

3. **General Improvements**:
   - Added secureTextEntry for password field
   - Added proper keyboard types
   - Added loading state UI feedback
   - Fixed typo in "account"

## Testing Steps:

1. **Start the API server**:
   ```bash
   cd ChatApp/api
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start the React Native app**:
   ```bash
   cd ChatApp
   npm install
   npx react-native run-android  # or run-ios
   ```

3. **Test Login**:
   - Enter a valid email and password
   - Press the "Log In" button
   - Check console for any errors
   - Verify navigation to main screen

## Common Issues to Check:

1. **API Server**: Make sure it's running on port 4000
2. **Network**: Ensure the app can reach 10.0.2.2:4000 (Android emulator)
3. **Database**: Check if MongoDB connection is working
4. **User Registration**: Make sure you have a registered user to test with

## Debug Commands:

```bash
# Check if API server is running
curl http://10.0.2.2:4000/logIn

# Check MongoDB connection
# Look for "Connected to mongo DB" in API console

# Check React Native logs
npx react-native log-android  # or log-ios
```
